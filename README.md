PiEstimation
============
Estimates pi using Buffon's Needle (explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJVivjuMfWA)

With 1 Billion simulated drops, the estimation gets pi to 4 decimal places. 
Experiment with "stick" length and gap width.

This is a numbers only program, tosses are simulated by generating a random y coordinate for the top of the "stick", and its corresponding bottom coordinate in a single dimension plane. If the stick crosses over a divider (spaced every 2 lengths of the stick), that is counted. In the end the total number of sticks tossed is divided by the amount of crossing sticks to give a rough estimate of pi.

The most likely reason for error may be attributed to the pseudo-random nature of the numbers generated by Java's Random class.
